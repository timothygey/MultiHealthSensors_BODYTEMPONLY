# MultiHealthSensors_BODYTEMPONLY
An Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) Project. 
This repo contains the development of the android application with body temperature sensor only.
The multi-function IoMT system my team and I are developing aims to relieve the strain on the public healthcare system in supporting an increasingly aged population through the provision of cost-effective health monitoring.
